	Abstract = {The gravity gradient tensor (GGT) has been increasingly used in practical applications, but the advantages and the disadvantages of the analysis of GGT components versus the analysis of the vertical component of the gravity field are still debated. We analyse the performance of joint inversion of GGT components versus separate inversion of the gravity field alone, or of one tensor component. We perform our analysis by inspection of the Picard Plot, a Singular Value Decomposition tool, and analyse both synthetic data and gradiometer measurements carried out at the Vredefort structure, South Africa. We show that the main factors controlling the reliability of the inversion are algebraic ambiguity (the difference between the number of unknowns and the number of available data points) and signal-to-noise ratio. Provided that algebraic ambiguity is kept low and the noise level is small enough so that a sufficient number of SVD components can be included in the regularized solution, we find that: (i) the choice of tensor components involved in the inversion is not crucial to the overall reliability of the reconstructions; (ii) GGT inversion can yield the same resolution as inversion with a denser distribution of gravity data points, but with the advantage of using fewer measurement stations.},

@article{Qin201652,
	Abstract = {Abstract Gravity data, which are critical in mineral, oil, and gas exploration, are obtained from the vertical component of the gravity field, while gravity gradient data are measured from changes in the gravity field in three directions. However, few studies have sought to improve exploration techniques by integrating gravity and gravity gradient data using inversion methods. In this study, we developed a new method to integrate gravity and gravity gradient data in a 3D density inversion using the non-linear conjugate gradient (NLCG) method and the minimum gradient support (MGS) functional to regularize the 3D inverse problem and to obtain a clear and accurate image of the anomalous body. The \{NLCG\} algorithm, which is suitable for solving large-scale nonlinear optimization problems and requires no memory storage, was compared to the Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton algorithm and the results indicated that the convergence rate of \{NLCG\} is slower, but that the storage requirement and computation time is lower. To counteract the decay in kernel function, we introduced a depth weighting function for anomalous bodies at the same depth, with information about anomalous body depth obtained from well log and seismic exploration data. For anomalous bodies at different depths, we introduced a spatial gradient weighting function to incorporate additional information obtained in the inversion. We concluded that the spatial gradient weighting function enhanced the spatial resolution of the recovered model. Furthermore, our results showed that including multiple components for inversion increased the resolution of the recovered model. We validated our model by applying our inversion method to survey data from Vinton salt dome, Louisiana, USA. The results showed good agreement with known geologic information; thus confirming the accuracy of this approach. },

	Abstract = {Metamodelling offers an efficient way to imitate the behaviour of computationally expensive simulators. Kriging based metamodels are popular in approximating computation-intensive simulations of deterministic nature. Irrespective of the existence of various variants of Kriging in the literature, only a handful of Kriging implementations are publicly available and most, if not all, free libraries only provide the standard Kriging metamodel. ooDACE toolbox offers a robust, flexible and easily extendable framework where various Kriging variants are implemented in an object-oriented fashion under a single platform. This paper presents an incremental update of the ooDACE toolbox introducing an implementation of Gradient Enhanced Kriging which has been tested and validated on several engineering problems.},

@article{Ulaganathan2016a,
	Abstract = {Abstract Kriging-based metamodels are popular for approximating computationally expensive black-box simulations, but suffer from an exponential growth of required training samples as the dimensionality of the problem increases. While a Gradient Enhanced Kriging metamodel with less training samples is able to approximate more accurately than a Kriging-based metamodel, it is prohibitively expensive to build for high dimensional problems. This limits the applicability of Gradient Enhanced Kriging for high dimensional metamodelling. In this work, this limitation is alleviated by coupling Gradient Enhanced Kriging with High Dimensional Model Representation. The approach, known as Gradient Enhanced Kriging based High Dimensional Model Representation, is accompanied by a highly efficient sequential sampling scheme LOLA-Voronoi and is applied to various high dimensional benchmark functions and one real-life simulation problem of varying dimensionality (10D--100D). Test results show that the combination of inexpensive gradient information and the high dimensional model representation can break or at least loosen the limitations associated with high dimensional Kriging metamodelling.},

	Abstract = {In this article we develop a random field model for the mean temperature over the region in the northern United States covering eastern Montana through the Dakotas and northern Nebraska up to the Canadian border. The readings are temperatures at the stations in the U.S. historical climatological network. The stochastic structure is modeled by a stationary spatial-temporal Gaussian random field. For this region, we find little evidence of temporal dependence while the spatial structure is temporally stable. The approach strives to incorporate the uncertainty in estimating the covariance structure into the predictive distributions and the final inference. As an application of the model, we derive posterior distributions of the areal mean over time. A posterior distribution for the static areal mean is presented as a basis for calibrating temperature shifts by the historical record. For this region and season, the distribution indicates that under the scenario of a gradual increase of 5<sup>⚬</sup> F over 50 years, it will take 30-40 winters of data before the change will be discernible from the natural variation in temperatures.},

	Abstract = {The Element-Free-Galerkin-method may be regarded as an alternative to the Finite-Element-method especially for problems with discontinuities, e.g. crack propagation problems. The EFG-method differs from the \{FEM\} by using the Moving-Least-Squares-interpolation. The behaviour of this interpolation is strongly influenced by a weighting function, which rules the influence of nodal variables on variables in arbitrary spatial points. With an appropriate selection of the weighting function derivatives of field functions of any desired order are continuous throughout the problem domain within the MLS-interpolation. Hence, gradients of stresses and strains may be calculated throughout the problem domain with a high accuracy. Furthermore, the configuration of nodes is quite flexible, as nodes are not ordered by an element connectivity. Nodes are easily introduced, moved or discarded. The latter characteristics make the EFG-method especially suitable for adaptive schemes. A scheme based on strain gradients is discussed in this paper. It is applied to several linear and physically nonlinear problems with high stress-resp. strain gradients and singularities. Continued mesh refinement in areas of high gradients is derived. The convergence behaviour is investigated for cases, where analytical solutions are available. },

@article{Zhou2006a,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel numerical method, the moving least square Ritz method (MLS-Ritz), for free vibration analysis of classical thin plates. The proposed method utilizes the strength of the moving least square approach to define the Ritz trial function for the transverse displacement of the plates. A set of points is pre-selected on the calculation domain of a plate that forms the basis for the MLS-Ritz trial function. The edge support conditions of the plate are satisfied by forcing the boundary points to meet the geometric boundary conditions of the plate via a point substitution technique. Virtual points (points outside the plate domain) are introduced for clamped edges to improve the convergence and accuracy of the calculations. Square and right-angled isosceles triangular plates of various combinations of edge support conditions are selected to examine the validity and accuracy of the MLS-Ritz method. Extensive convergence studies are carried out to investigate the influence of the \{MLS\} mesh size, the \{MLS\} support radius, the number of Gaussian integration points and the shape of the \{MLS\} weight function on the proposed method. Comparing with the existing Ritz methods, the MLS-Ritz method is highly stable and accurate and is extremely flexible for dealing with plates of arbitrary shapes and boundary conditions. },

	Abstract = {Optimisation strategies on assembly design are often relatively time expensive because of the large number of non-linear calculations (due to contact or friction problems) required to localize the optimum of an objective function. In order to achieve this kind of optimization problems with an acceptable computational time, this work propose to use a two-levels model optimization strategy based on two main tools: (1) the multiparametric strategy based on the LaTIn method that enables to reduce significantly the computational time for solving many similar mechanical assembly problems and (2) a cokriging metamodel built using responses and gradients computed by the mechanical solver on few sets of design parameters. The metamodel provides very inexpensive approximate responses of the objective function and it enables to achieve a global optimisation and to obtain the global optimum. The cokriging metamodel was reviewed in detail using analytical test functions and some mechanical benchmarks. The quality of the approximation and the building cost were compared with classical kriging approach. Moreover, a complete study of the multiparametric strategy was proposed using many mechanical benchmarks included many kinds and numbers of design parameters. The performance in term of computational time of the whole optimisation process was illustrated.},

@techreport{Platt1998a,
	Abstract = {<p>This paper proposes a new algorithm for training support vector machines:
                Sequential Minimal Optimization , or SMO . Training a support vector machine
                requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization
                problem. SMO breaks this large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP
                problems. These small QP problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a
                time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory
                required for SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle
                very large training sets. Because matrix computation is avoided, SMO scales
                somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test
                problems, while the standard chunking SVM algorithm scales somewhere between
                linear and cubic in the training set size. SMO's computation time is dominated by
                SVM evaluation, hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. On
                real- world sparse data sets, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the
                chunking algorithm.</p>},

For the linear and nonlinear cases, these parameters are obtained by solving a system of linear and nonlinear equations, respectively.

@article{Bloch2008a,
	Abstract = {This paper considers nonlinear modeling based on a limited amount of experimental data and a simulator built from prior knowledge. The problem of how to best incorporate the data provided by the simulator, possibly biased, into the learning of the model is addressed. This problem, although particular, is very representative of numerous situations met in engine control, and more generally in engineering, where complex models, more or less accurate, exist and where the experimental data which can be used for calibration are difficult or expensive to obtain. The first proposed method constrains the function to fit to the values given by the simulator with a certain accuracy, allowing to take the bias of the simulator into account. The second method constrains the derivatives of the model to fit to the derivatives of a prior model previously estimated on the simulation data. The combination of these two forms of prior knowledge is also possible and considered. These approaches are implemented in the linear programming support vector regression (LP-SVR) framework by the addition, to the optimization problem, of constraints, which are linear with respect to the parameters. Tests are then performed on an engine control application, namely, the estimation of the in-cylinder residual gas fraction in Spark Ignition (SI) engine with Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT). Promising results are obtained on this application. The experiments have also shown the importance of adding potential support vectors in the model when using Gaussian \{RBF\} kernels with very few training samples. },

In the \{RBF\} case, the Gaussian kernel is commonly used, while the spread parameter σ in the Gaussian kernel is essential to generalization performance of SVMs. In this paper, determination of σ is studied based on discussions of the influence of σ on generalization performance. For classification problems, the optimal σ can be computed on the basis of Fisher discrimination. And for regression problems, based on scale space theory, we demonstrate the existence of a certain range of σ, within which the generalization performance is stable. An appropriate σ within the range can be achieved via dynamic evaluation. In addition, the lower bound of iterating step size of σ is given. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the presented method. },

	Abstract = {We introduce the concept of span of support vectors (SV) and show that the generalization ability of support vector machines (SVM) depends on this new geometrical concept. We prove that the value of the span is always smaller (and can be much smaller) than the diameter of the smallest sphere containing the support vectors, used in previous bounds (Vapnik, 1998). We also demonstrate experimentally that the prediction of the test error given by the span is very accurate and has direct application in model selection (choice of the optimal parameters of the SVM).},

	Abstract = {The kernel-parameter is one of the few tunable parameters in Support Vector machines, controlling the complexity of the resulting hypothesis. Its choice amounts to model selection and its value is usually found by means of a validation set. We present an algorithm which can automatically perform model selection with little additional computational cost and with no need of a validation set. In this procedure model selection and learning are not separate, but kernels are dynamically adjusted during the learning process to find the kernel parameter which provides the best possible upper bound on the generalisation error. Theoretical results motivating the approach and experimental results confirming its validity are presented. 1 Introduction Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are learning systems designed to automatically trade-off accuracy and complexity by minimizing an upper bound on the generalisation error provided by VC theory. In practice, however, SVMs still have a few tunable parame...},

	Abstract = {Optimizations involving high-fidelity simulations can become prohibitively expensive when an exhaustive search is employed. To remove this expense a surrogate model is often constructed. One of the most popular techniques for the construction of such a surrogate model is that of kriging. However, the construction of a kriging model requires the optimization of a multi-model likelihood function, the cost of which can approach that of the high-fidelity simulations upon which the model is based. The article describes the development of a hybridized particle swarm algorithm which aims to reduce the cost of this likelihood optimization by drawing on an efficient adjoint of the likelihood. This hybridized tuning strategy is compared to a number of other strategies with respect to the inverse design of an airfoil as well as the optimization of an airfoil for minimum drag at a fixed lift},

	Abstract = {The process of likelihood maximization can be found in many different areas of computational modelling. However, the construction of such models via likelihood maximization requires the solution of a difficult multi-modal optimization problem involving an expensive O(n3) factorization. The optimization techniques used to solve this problem may require many such factorizations and can result in a significant bottleneck. This article derives an adjoint formulation of the likelihood employed in the construction of a kriging model via reverse algorithmic differentiation. This adjoint is found to calculate the likelihood and all of its derivatives more efficiently than the standard analytical method and can therefore be used within a simple local search or within a hybrid global optimization to accelerate convergence and therefore reduce the cost of the likelihood optimization. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society},

	Abstract = {Abstract The main objective of this paper is to propose an optimization strategy which uses partially converged data to minimize the computational effort associated with an optimization procedure. The framework of this work is the optimization of assemblies involving contact and friction. Several tools have been developed in order to use a surrogate model as an alternative to the actual mechanical model. Then, the global optimization can be carried out using this surrogate model, which is much less expensive. This approach has two drawbacks: the \{CPU\} time required to generate the surrogate model and the inaccuracy of this model. In order to alleviate these drawbacks, we propose to minimize the \{CPU\} time by using partially converged data and then to apply a correction strategy. Two methods are tested in this paper. The first one consists in updating a partially converged metamodel using global enrichment. The second one consists in seeking the global minimum using the weighted expected improvement. One can achieve a time saving of about 10 when seeking the global minimum. },

	Abstract = { Design sensitivity plays a critical role in inverse and identification studies, as well as numerical optimization, and reliability analysis. Herein, we review the state of design sensitivity analysis as it applies to linear elliptic systems. Both first- and second-order sensitivities are derived as well as first-order sensitivities for symmetric positive definite eigenvalue systems. Although these results are not new, some of the derivations offer a different perspective than those previously presented. This article is meant as a tutorial, and as such, a simple two-degree-of-freedom spring system is employed to exemplify the sensitivity analyses. However, the concepts presented in this trivial example may be readily extended to compute sensitivities for complex systems via numerical techniques such as the finite element, boundary element, and finite difference methods. },

	Abstract = {For models with dependent input variables, sensitivity analysis is often a troublesome work and only a few methods are available. Mara and Tarantola in their paper (``Variance-based sensitivity indices for models with dependent inputs'') defined a set of variance-based sensitivity indices for models with dependent inputs. We in this paper propose a method based on moving least squares approximation to calculate these sensitivity indices. The new proposed method is adaptable to both linear and nonlinear models since the moving least squares approximation can capture severe change in scattered data. Both linear and nonlinear numerical examples are employed in this paper to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method. Then the new sensitivity analysis method is applied to a cantilever beam structure and from the results the most efficient method that can decrease the variance of model output can be determined, and the efficiency is demonstrated by exploring the dependence of output variance on the variation coefficients of input variables. At last, we apply the new method to a headless rivet model and the sensitivity indices of all inputs are calculated, and some significant conclusions are obtained from the results. },

	Abstract = {Optimisation strategies on assembly design are often relatively time expensive because of the large number of non-linear calculations (due to contact or friction problems) required to localize the optimum of an objective function. In order to achieve this kind of optimization problems with an acceptable computational time, this work propose to use a two-levels model optimization strategy based on two main tools: (1) the multiparametric strategy based on the LaTIn method that enables to reduce significantly the computational time for solving many similar mechanical assembly problems and (2) a cokriging metamodel built using responses and gradients computed by the mechanical solver on few sets of design parameters. The metamodel provides very inexpensive approximate responses of the objective function and it enables to achieve a global optimisation and to obtain the global optimum. The cokriging metamodel was reviewed in detail using analytical test functions and some mechanical benchmarks. The quality of the approximation and the building cost were compared with classical kriging approach. Moreover, a complete study of the multiparametric strategy was proposed using many mechanical benchmarks included many kinds and numbers of design parameters. The performance in term of computational time of the whole optimisation process was illustrated.},

	Abstract = {Designing structural assemblies led to analysis of quasi-static problems with local nonlinearities such as unilateral contacts with friction. Therefore, optimization of structural assemblies is very expensive in terms of computation time. In order to reduce this cost, a two-level model optimization strategy based on the successive optimizations of a metamodel and of the full mechanical model is used [1] [2]. In the first level, a metamodel based on a cumulative approximation [3], and a global optimizer are used to obtain approximated optima and, in the second level, mechanical model is connected directly with a local optimizer for locating the precise optimum. The main drawback of this strategy is the CPU time required to generate the metamodel. In order to reduce the computation time we use a dedicated FEM for solving assembly problems based on a mixed domain decomposition and on an iterative scheme called LaTIn [4]. The assembly is decomposed into substructures with an elastic behavior and interfaces with a nonlinear law taking into account the frictional contact conditions. In the context of parametric optimization solved problems are very similar in the sense that only parameters varies. For a new set of design parameters, the LaTIn algorithm can be reinitialized using a previous converged solution and enables us to obtain faster convergence. The reuse of converged solution called MultiParametric Strategy [5] leads a significant reduction of computational time. The main objective of this study is to improve the MultiParametric Strategy by an optimization of the reinitialisation step. We use the fact that with a previous close solution only a few iterations are needed to reach convergence in the new calculation. Different norms on the parameters' space and taking into account metamodel responses are defined and compared. The strategy allows us to significantly reduce the computation time associated to the building of the metamodel (gain greater than 20) and, consequently, of the whole optimization process. This strategy will be presented on an industrial test-case of torque transmission by friction.

	Abstract = {To control the numerical quality of non-linear simulations allows to automate the choice of discretisation. Within the framework of time dependent problems, this quality depends on the error made in the calculation of the deformation history. Generally, a kind of expert analysis precedes the satisfying computation. In practice, this analysis could be an optimisation of numerical approximations. We propose a strategy herein, which naturally includes this expert analysis stage. The desired solution is built iteratively, improving all of the history at each iteration, thanks to the \{LATIN\} method. A global error estimator is provided by the dissipation error. To pilot the adaptive computation, we propose a partition of this estimator into indicators associated with each kind of error contribution. },

The area of computer experiments has started to provide such designs especially Latin hypercube and lattice designs. System decomposition, prevalent in several branches of engineering, can be employed to decrease complexity. A combination of system decomposition using a sparse matrix method, experimental design and modelling is applied to one example of an electrical circuit simulator producing a usable emulator of the circuit for use in optimization and sensitivity analysis.},

@article{Kleijnen2000,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology that replaces the usual ad hoc approach to metamodeling. This methodology considers validation of a metamodel with respect to both the underlying simulation model and the problem entity. It distinguishes between fitting and validating a metamodel, and covers four types of goal: (i) understanding, (ii) prediction, (iii) optimization, and (iv) verification and validation. The methodology consists of a metamodeling process with 10 steps. This process includes classic design of experiments (DOE) and measuring fit through standard measures such as R-square and cross-validation statistics. The paper extends this \{DOE\} to stagewise DOE, and discusses several validation criteria, measures, and estimators. The methodology covers metamodels in general (including neural networks); it also gives a specific procedure for developing linear regression (including polynomial) metamodels for random simulation. },

@article{Nguyen2008,
	Abstract = {The motivation of the paper is to develop a method allowing us to make use, in the context of identification, of highly perturbed tests leading to non-reliable measurements. Such tests are not seldom especially when dealing with structural fracture in dynamics. We follow here the concept of the modified constitutive relation error (MCRE) [1] where error on the model and error on the experimental data are both introduced. A first paper was devoted to the extension of the MCRE method to transient elasticity [2]. This paper is devoted to the extension to nonlinear constitutive relations, in particular viscoplasticity and damage. The MCRE formulation in transient dynamics leads to the solving of a coupled direct and adjoint nonlinear problem, which implies dedicated methods, which is the core of this paper. This has led us to define a particular MCRE formulation well suited for numerical treatment and to develop an extension of the LATIN method [3] to ill-posed problems. Once the difficulties have been resolved and the formulation implemented in the one-dimensional case, the proposed identification strategy appears to be very robust with respect to perturbed measurements in the absence of a priori knowledge, even in the case of localization and rupture.},

	Abstract = {When subjected to low-velocity impacts, the high damage/sensitivity of carbon/epoxy laminated composites results in localised damage, mainly transverse cracks and delaminations. To be able to assess the critical nature of the induced damage, a thorough description of the damage mechanisms is of primary importance. The challenge here is the prediction of the initiation and the propagation of low-velocity impact-induced damage by the use of damage mechanics. Therefore, a mechanical and numerical model of the damage occurring in laminates, previously defined at Laboratoire de M{\'e}canique et de Technologie (LMT) is updated to this specific type of loading. Preliminary results show a good correlation with accurate experimental measures. },

@article{Allix1992,
	Abstract = {Delamination is a phenomenon which involves complex degradations of layers and interlaminar connections. In order to take these degradations into account, a laminate is modelled as a stacking sequence of homogeneous layers and interlaminar interfaces. The aim of this article is to focus on the interface modelling and first identification. The interface is a three-dimensional medium the thickness of which is negligible compared to the in-plane dimensions. Therefore it can be modelled as a two-dimensional entity which ensures displacement and traction transfer from one ply to another. The interface depends on the angle between the fibre directions of two adjacent layers. In the first instance it is assumed to be elastic and damageable. The main interest of this model is that, using only a few intrinsic characteristics of the interface, it is possible to predict the tendency of a structure to delaminate. One of the main difficulties is to identify these characteristics. This approach allows a clear connection between fracture mechanics and damage mechanics. This modelling has been used for the predicting of delamination initiation and growth in the case of static loadings without buckling. },

@article{Torn1977,
	Abstract = {A model for finding the local optima of a multimodal function defined in a region A {\^A}¿ Rn is proposed. The method uses a local optimizer which is started from a number of points sampled in A. In order to reduce the number of function evaluations needed to reach the local optima, the parallel local search processes are stopped repeatedly, the working points clustered, and a reduced number of processes from each cluster resumed. A direct nonhierarchical cluster analysis technique is presented. The dissimilarity measure used is the Euclidean distance between points. Clusters are grown from seed points. The number of required distance evaluations is less than or equal to c(n-1), where n is the number of points and c is the number of clusters arrived at. Thresholds are determined by the point density in a body which in turn is determined by the given points. The covariance matrix is diagonalized, and a decision on the dimensionality of the space containing the points can be made. The volume of the body is proportional to the square root of the product of the corresponding eigenvalues. The performance of the clustering analysis technique is illustrated. It is demonstrated that there exist classes of global optimization problems for which the probability of obtaining a solution is greater for the proposed model than for multiple local optimizations. Some experiences gained from using the model are reported.},

@incollection{Sorensen1982,
	Abstract = {Unconstrained minimization of a real valued differentiable function of several real variables is a fundamental problem of mathematical programming. There are many algorithms for obtaining a numerical approximation to a solution of an unconstrained minimization problem. The most effective algorithms are usually iterative and are based upon some variant of Newtonʼs method for finding a zero of the gradient of the objective function. It is well known that Newton's method must be modified in various ways in order to produce a robust optimization algorithm. Such modifications are generally designed to force convergence of the sequence of iterates to a point which satisfies as many necessary conditions for minimization as possible. The most familiar modifications of this type generally compute a search direction followed by a line search to obtain a new iterate from the previous iterate. Recently, various strategies have been introduced which have been designed to make better use of second order information when it is available. These strategies have resulted in iterations which converge to critical points which satisfy second order necessary conditions for minimization. In this paper an alternate approach to safeguarding Newton-like methods is discussed. The approach is well known. It is appropriately called a model trust region method in that the step to a new iterate is obtained by minimizing a local model to the objective function over a restricted ellipsoidal region centered about the current iterate. The diameter of this region is expanded and contracted in a controlled way based upon how well the local model predicts behavior of the objective function. This strategy will force convergence of the iterates to a critical point which satisfies second order necessary conditions for minimization under very reasonable assumptions about the objective function.},

@article{Kitanidis1983,
	Abstract = {Minimum-variance unbiased linear estimation theory has found many applications in the analysis of spatial rainfall and Hydrogeologic data: estimation of point values or areal averages, calculation of variances of estimation error, and network design. However, the important problem of inferring the spatial structure or interdependence of the function of interest has received relatively less attention. Three methods for the estimation of the parameters of Matheron's polynomial generalized covariance function (a useful model for nonstationary functions) are presented and evaluated: Maximum likelihood (ML), minimum variance unbiased quadratic (MVUQ), and minimum norm (least squares). The estimation error covariance matrix of the parameters is calculated with each of these methods. ML and MVUQ estimation have very good properties and, for reasonably large samples, give very similar results. Minimum norm estimation is appropriate for preliminary data analysis. The application of these methodologies is illustrated with a set of rainfall data, and problems of implementation are discussed. It is shown that the estimation of the parameters of the covariance function involves sizeable errors. It is suggested that, in practice, it may be rather difficult to identify the parameters of all but simple models. It is important that future research evaluate the effects of parameter uncertainty in the circulation of estimation error variances of point or areal averages and in the design of hydrologic data collection networks.},

@article{Kushner1964,
	Abstract = {A versatile and practical method of searching a parameter space is presented. Theoretical and experimental results illustrate the usefulness of the method for such problems as the experimental optimization of the performance of a system with a very general multipeak performance function when the only available information is noise-distributed samples of the function. At present, its usefulness is restricted to optimization with respect to one system parameter. The observations are taken sequentially; but, as opposed to the gradient method, the observation may be located anywhere on the parameter interval. A sequence of estimates of the location of the curve maximum is generated. The location of the next observation may be interpreted as the location of the most likely competitor (with the current best estimate) for the location of the curve maximum. A Brownian motion stochastic process is selected as a model for the unknown function, and the observations are interpreted with respect to the model. The model gives the results a simple intuitive interpretation and allows the use of simple but efficient sampling procedures. The resulting process possesses some powerful convergence properties in the presence of noise; it is nonparametric and, despite its generality, is efficient in the use of observations. The approach seems quite promising as a solution to many of the problems of experimental system optimization.},

First, the problem is solved for a one-dimensional input space by using the ε -insensitive loss function and introducing additional constraints in the approximation of the derivative. Then, we extend the method to multi-dimensional input spaces by a multidimensional regression algorithm. In both cases, to optimize the regression estimation problem, we have derived an iterative re-weighted least squares (IRWLS) procedure that works fast for moderate-size problems. The proposed method shows that using the information about derivatives significantly improves the reconstruction of the function.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a new variant of the radial basis function networks (RBFNs) with enhanced capacity to approximate any input--output mapping defined by a collection of activation signals and the corresponding responses. The new multivariate interpolation tool is conceptually drawn upon the standard formulation of RBFNs. However, the nonlinear mapping from the input to the hidden network units is modified by taking into account approximate values of the directional slopes of the response surface with respect to the free parameters. The \{RBF\} centers are selected in a forward manner and the activation function acts upon ``distances'' between input patterns and the \{RBF\} centers with components scaled by the aforementioned slopes. The latter should be viewed as local sensitivity measures simultaneously computed by the network itself. The improved performance of the new gradient-assisted radial basis function networks (GARBFNs) as interpolation tools will be demonstrated using a multimodal analytical function and two industrial applications related to the aerodynamic performance of airfoils and the thermodynamic performance of a gas turbine combined-cycle power plant. },

	Abstract = {Variable-fidelity surrogate modeling offers an efficient way to generate aerodynamic data for aero-loads prediction based on a set of \{CFD\} methods with varying degree of fidelity and computational expense. In this paper, direct Gradient-Enhanced Kriging (GEK) and a newly developed Generalized Hybrid Bridge Function (GHBF) have been combined in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the existing Variable-Fidelity Modeling (VFM) approach. The new algorithms and features are demonstrated and evaluated for analytical functions and are subsequently used to construct a global surrogate model for the aerodynamic coefficients and drag polar of an \{RAE\} 2822 airfoil. It is shown that the gradient-enhanced \{GHBF\} proposed in this paper is very promising and can be used to significantly improve the efficiency, accuracy and robustness of \{VFM\} in the context of aero-loads prediction. },

	Abstract = {Optimisation of complex systems frequently requires evaluating a computationally expensive high-fidelity function to estimate a system metric of interest. Although design sensitivities may be available through either direct or adjoint methods, the use of formal optimisation methods may remain too costly. Incorporating low-fidelity performance estimates can substantially reduce the cost of the high-fidelity optimisation. In this paper we present a provably convergent multifidelity optimisation method that uses Cokriging Bayesian model calibration and first-order consistent trust regions. The technique is compared with a single-fidelity sequential quadratic programming method and a conventional first-order trust-region method on both a two-dimensional structural optimisation and an aerofoil design problem. In both problems adjoint formulations are used to provide inexpensive sensitivity information.},

@article{Ranjan2011,
	Abstract = { For many expensive deterministic computer simulators, the outputs do not have replication error and the desired metamodel (or statistical emulator) is an interpolator of the observed data. Realizations of Gaussian spatial processes (GP) are commonly used to model such simulator outputs. Fitting a GP model to n data points requires the computation of the inverse and determinant of n×n correlation matrices, R, that are sometimes computationally unstable due to near-singularity of R. This happens if any pair of design points are very close together in the input space. The popular approach to overcome near-singularity is to introduce a small nugget (or jitter) parameter in the model that is estimated along with other model parameters. The inclusion of a nugget in the model often causes unnecessary over-smoothing of the data. In this article, we propose a lower bound on the nugget that minimizes the over-smoothing and an iterative regularization approach to construct a predictor that further improves the interpolation accuracy. We also show that the proposed predictor converges to the GP interpolator. },

@article{Wahba1985,
	Abstract = {The partially improper prior behind the smoothing spline model is used to obtain a generalization of the maximum likelihood (GML) estimate for the smoothing parameter. Then this estimate is compared with the generalized cross validation (GCV) estimate both analytically and by Monte Carlo methods. The comparison is based on a predictive mean square error criteria. It is shown that if the true, unknown function being estimated is smooth in a sense to be defined then the GML estimate undersmooths relative to the GCV estimate and the predictive mean square error using the GML estimate goes to zero at a slower rate than the mean square error using the GCV estimate. If the true function is "rough" then the GCV and GML estimates have asymptotically similar behavior. A Monte Carlo experiment was designed to see if the asymptotic results in the smooth case were evident in small sample sizes. Mixed results were obtained for n = 32, GCV was somewhat better than GML for n = 64, and GCV was decidedly superior for n = 128. In the n = 32 case GCV was better for smaller σ2 and the comparison close for larger σ2. The theoretical results are shown to extend to the generalized spline smoothing model, which includes the estimate of functions given noisy values of various integrals of them.},

@article{Stein1990,
	Abstract = {Wahba compared the performance of generalized cross validation (GCV) and modified maximum likelihood (MML) procedures for choosing the smoothing parameter of a smoothing spline. This work makes a more careful study of the two procedures when the stochastic model motivating the modified maximum likelihood estimate is correct. In particular, it is shown that in the case of the linear smoothing spline with equally spaced observations, both estimates are asymptotically normal with the GCV estimate having twice the asymptotic variance of the MML estimate. The impact of using these estimates on the subsequent predictions is also calculated. Conjectures on how these results should generalize to higher order smoothing splines are developed. These conjectures suggest that the penalty for using GCV instead of MML when the stochastic model is correct is greater for higher order smoothing splines, both in terms of the efficiency in estimating the smoothing parameter and the impact on subsequent predictions.},

It addresses the requirements for effective industrial use, and trade-offs between modeling accuracy and computational costs. Essential elements of algorithm design are discussed in detail, together with a unified approach to the design of shock capturing schemes. Finally, the paper discusses the use of techniques drawn from control theory to determine optimal aerodynamic shapes. In the future multidisciplinary analysis and optimization should be combined to take account of the trade-offs in the overall performance of the complete system. },

	Abstract = {A numerical method for estimating accurate first derivative, f{\^a}€²(x), of a function, f(x) is proposed. This methodology leads to the approximate determination of an optimal step which minimizes rounding and truncation errors. The method described here has been applied to different functions and its performance compared with that of classical methods using a proportional step length and that of Dumontet and Vignes. We show that on a large field of application this algorithm tends to associate the efficiency of the optimal step method with the requisite of a moderate number of evaluations. },

	Abstract = {Numerical derivatives play an important role in many computations. In many applications, the cost associated with evaluation of numerical derivatives may be significant. Dramatic improvements in the speed of such calculations can be obtained through careful consideration of how these derivatives are computed. This paper reviews several ways in which numerical derivatives can be evaluated: hand-coding, finite difference approximations, reverse polish notation evaluation, symbolic differentiation, and automatic differentiation. It is concluded that automatic differentiation has significant advantages over all other approaches. Several ways of improving the efficiency of obtaining derivatives in an interpretive, symbolic environment are discussed. Example problems are compared to illustrate these improvements. },

	Abstract = {Models encountered in computational mechanics could involve many time scales. 
	When these time scales cannot be separated, one must solve the evolution model in the entire 
	time interval by using the finest time step that the model implies. In some cases, the solution 
	procedure becomes cumbersome because of the extremely large number of time steps needed for 
	integrating the evolution model in the whole time interval. In this paper, we considered an 
	alternative approach that lies in separating the time axis (one-dimensional in nature) in a

	Abstract = {Kinetic theory models involving the Fokker-Planck equation can be accurately discretized using a mesh support (finite elements, finite differences, finite volumes, spectral techniques, etc.). However, these techniques involve a high number of approximation functions. In the finite element framework, widely used in complex flow simulations, each approximation function is related to a node that defines the associated degree of freedom. When the model involves high dimensional spaces (including physical and conformation spaces and time), standard discretization techniques fail due to an excessive computation time required to perform accurate numerical simulations. One appealing strategy that allows circumventing this limitation is based on the use of reduced approximation basis within an adaptive procedure making use of an efficient separation of variables. },

	Abstract = {Nearly every numerical analysis algorithm has computational complexity that scales exponentially in the underlying physical dimension. The separated representation, introduced previously, allows many operations to be performed with scaling that is formally linear in the dimension. In this paper we further develop this representation by

(i) discussing the variety of mechanisms that allow it to be surprisingly efficient;

(ii) addressing the issue of conditioning;

(iii) presenting algorithms for solving linear systems within this framework; and

(iv) demonstrating methods for dealing with antisymmetric functions, as arise in the multiparticle Schr{\"o}dinger equation in quantum mechanics.

Numerical examples are given.

	Abstract = {In this paper, a multi-solution strategy aimed at greatly decreasing
	the cost of structural identification problems is proposed. It is
	based on the large time increment method and on the possibility offered
	by this approach to obtain a family of admissible displacement and
	stress fields in order to solve a nonlinear time-dependent problem.
	This technique relies on a time and space decomposition of the solution.
	It has been extended to solve at a low cost, the inverse problem
	of identification, for various techniques. In particular, it has
	been adapted to the minimization of the gradient of the gap between
	test and simulation. In this first attempt, it is applied to the
	simple case of bending of an elastic--viscoplastic beam. The issue
	of the numerical efficiency of this type of strategy is studied.

	model is revisited in order to take into account the damage of elastomers
	and the opening and the closing of micro-defects. Applications concern

	are typical solicitations for these structures. Whenever the material
	is able to undergo very large deformations (600-700%), the
	simulation of this type of experiment up to so high strains is not
	easy. The failure of industrial finite element code leads us to develop
	a prototype software using a non-incremental method (large time increment

	stage are successively carried out by an iterative algorithm until

	a FEM (3D case) or by another approach using Trefftz functions (2D

	little confidence in the results. Thus, it appears to necessary to

	Abstract = {The aim of the present work is to develop an application of the LArge
	Time INcrement (LATIN) approach for the parametric analysis of static
	problems with multiple contacts. The methodology adopted was originally
	introduced to solve viscoplastic and large-transformation problems.
	Here, the applications concern elastic, quasi-static structural assemblies
	with local non-linearities such as unilateral contact with friction.
	Our approach is based on a decomposition of the assembly into substructures
	and interfaces. The interfaces play the vital role of enabling the
	local non-linearities, such as contact and friction, to be modelled
	easily and accurately. The problem on each substructure is solved
	by the finite element method and an iterative scheme based on the
	LATIN method is used for the global resolution. More specifically,
	the objective is to calculate a large number of design configurations.
	Each design configuration corresponds to a set of values of all the
	variable parameters (friction coefficients, prestress) which are
	introduced into the mechanical analysis. A full computation is needed
	for each set of parameters. Here we propose, as an alternative to
	carrying out these full computations, to use the capability of the
	LATIN method to re-use the solution to a given problem (for one set
	of parameters) in order to solve similar problems (for the other
	sets of parameters). Copyright {\copyright} 2003 John Wiley & Sons,

	a computation time that winds up becoming prohibitive. Moreover,
	with respect to those structural analyses involving multiple solution
	sequences (parametric studies, structures with defect, etc.), each

@article{Boucard1997,
	Abstract = {In structural mechanics, nearly all the current computations for time
	dependent nonlinear problems (e.g. plasticity, viscoplasticity or
	damage) use step-by-step methods. In contrast, for small displacement
	problems, the large time incremental (LATIN) method, introduced by
	Ladev{\`e}ze [C.r. Acad. Sci. Paris Ser. II300, 41-44
	(1985).], is an iterative method which accounts for the whole loading
	process in a single time increment which is not a priori limited.
	To give an idea of the step length, several loading cycles (or even
	several thousand) can be simulated in a single time increment. The
	performance of the method is excellent in problems with many degrees
	of freedom or complicated loads [Ph. Boisse, P. Bussy and P. Ladev{\`e}ze,
	Int. J. numer. Meth. Engng29, 632-647 (1990); P. Ladev{\`e}ze,
	In: New Advances in Computational Structural Mechanics (Edited by
	P. Ladev{\`e}ze and O. C. Zienkiewick), pp. 3-21. Elsevier,
	Oxford (1992)]. A preliminary extension to large displacement problems
	has been presented and applied to deep drawing simulation in [P.
	Bussy, P. Roug{\~A}{\copyright}e and P. Vauchez, In: Proc. Numerical
	Methods in Engineering, pp. 102-109. Elsevier, Oxford (1990)].
	The present work concerns another extension, suitable for material
	models with internal variables, as described by Ladev{\`e}ze [C.r.
	Acad. Sci. Paris Ser. II309, 1095-1099 (1989)]; more details
	concerning this extension can be found in [P. Ladev{\`e}ze, Sur
	une th{\~A}{\copyright}orie des grandes transformations: modelisation
	et calcul, Rapport interne du \{LMT\} no. 125 (1991)]. The objective
	herein is to describe the main ideas of the method, and to show with
	simple beam buckling problems how the pre and post buckling response
	of a structure may be obtained simultaneously without any continuation
	technique and with less than 10 iterations. },

	Abstract = {The objective of this work is to develop an efficient strategy for

	the multiscale LATIN method, called the multiparametric strategy,
	to reuse the solution of a given problem in order to solve similar
	problems. This strategy has already been applied successfully to
	a variety of static problems; here, it is extended to dynamics. First,
	we present the multiscale strategy in dynamics. Then, we show how
	the multiparametric strategy can be extended to dynamics. We illustrate
	the capabilities of the method through an academic 3D example and

	Abstract = { Abstract The general problem is considered of choosing a design such
	that (a) the polynomial f(ξ) = f(ξ1, ξ2, · · ·, ξ k ) in the
	k continuous variables ξ' = (ξ1, ξ2, · · ·, ξ k ) fitted by
	the method of least squares most closely represents the true function
	g(ξ1, ξ2, · · ·, ξ k ) over some ``region of interest'' R in
	the ξ space, no restrictions being introduced that the experimental
	points should necessarily lie inside R; and (b) subject to satisfaction
	of (a), there is a high chance that inadequacy of f(ξ) to represent
	g(ξ) will be detected. When the observations are subject to error,
	discrepancies between the fitted polynomial and the true function
	occur: i. due to sampling error (called here ``variance error''),
	and ii. due to the inadequacy of the polynomial f(ξ) exactly to
	represent g(ξ) (called here ``bias error''). To meet requirement
	(a) the design is selected so as to minimize J, the expected mean
	square error averaged over the region R. J contains two components,
	one associated entirely with variance error and the other associated
	entirely with bias error. There is a class of designs which satisfy
	requirement (a). To meet requirement (b) we select from this class
	a subclass for which the ``non-centrality term'' in the expectation
	of the residual sum of squares in the analysis of variance is large.
	This leads to a sensitive test of goodness of fit. In this paper
	the theory is applied to the particular case where f(ξ) is a polynomial
	of first degree and g(ξ) a polynomial of second degree; that is,
	the experimenter is hopefully fitting a first degree equation over
	the region R in the circumstances where the true function is really
	quadratic. The somewhat unexpected conclusion is reached that, at
	least in the cases considered, the optimal design in typical situations
	in which both variance and bias occur is very nearly the same as
	would be obtained if variance were ignored completely and the experiment
	designed so as to minimize bias alone. Particular examples of the
	class of optimal designs derived are fractional by replicated two-level
	factorial designs (in which no two-factor interaction is confounded
	with the main effect) with added center points. Particular examples
	of the class of optimal designs derived are fractional by replicated
	two-level factorial designs (in which no two-factor interaction is

	d{\'e}crire facilement le d{\'e}tail. Le deuxi{\'e}me utilise une

	m{\'e}thode de d{\'e}composition de domaine mixte et une strat{\'e}gie

	Abstract = {The aim of the present work is to present an efficient numerical tool
	for the simulation of the behavior of 3D assemblies of structures
	with contact and friction when strong structural modifications occur.
	The paper focuses on the effects of missing connection elements (screws,
	bolts, rivets, {\ldots}) on the behavior of the assembly. A fast
	and efficient domain decomposition strategy for predicting the responses
	of an assembly for different configurations of missing elements is
	proposed. The efficiency is provided by the use of a pre-calculated
	solution as initialization for the calculation of a new design configuration.
	Applications are concerned with bolted joints under quasi-static
	loads. },

@article{Cognard1999,
	Abstract = {We extend a new approach to the non-isothermal case, for the resolution
	of isothermal viscoplastic problems. The computational method is
	well suited for non-linear mechanical behaviour, described by internal
	variables. This approach is in contrast with the classical step-by-step
	method, as it is an iterative procedure that takes the whole loading
	process in a single time interval into account. The main point is
	to introduce a formulation of the thermo-mechanical problem adapted
	to the strategy that we use; we gather all the non-linearities in
	the evolution laws in order to obtain the linear state laws by using
	a change of variables that also allows us to remove the temperature
	from the state laws, except from Hooke{\'s} elasticity
	law (in which the effects of temperature are smooth). This formulation,
	called the normal formulation, is of great interest as it is well
	suited to most of the classical computational techniques and is particularly
	appropriate for the \{LArge\} Time Increment (LATIN) method that
	we use. Several examples illustrate the possibilities and efficiency
	of this strategy. A good accuracy is obtained in a few iterations,
	even in the case of realistic loading histories, and only a few linear
	elastic-type global problems have to be solved. },

@book{Cressie1993,
	Abstract = {Spatial statistics-analyzing spatial data through statistical models-has
	proven exceptionally versatile, encompassing problems ranging from
	the microscopic to the astronomic. However, for the scientist and
	engineer faced only with scattered and uneven treatments of the subject
	in the scientific literature, learning how to make practical use
	of spatial statistics in day-to-day analytical work has approached
	the impossible. Designed exclusively for the scientist eager to tap
	into the enormous potential of this analytical tool and upgrade his
	range of technical skills, Statistics for Spatial Data is a comprehensive,
	single-source guide to both the theory and applied aspects of current
	spatial statistical methods. The previous edition was hailed by Mathematical
	Reviews as an "excellent book which.will become a basic reference."
	This revised edition, an update of the 1991 edition, has been designed
	to meet the many technological challenges facing the scientist and
	engineer today. Concentrating on the three areas of geostatistical
	data, lattice data, and point patterns, the book sheds light on the
	link between data and model, revealing how design, inference, and
	diagnostics are an outgrowth of that link. It then explores new methods
	to reveal just how spatial statistical models can be used to solve
	important problems in a host of areas in science and engineering.
	
	Discussion includes: * Exploratory spatial data analysis * Spectral
	theory for stationary processes * Spatial scale * Simulation methods
	for spatial processes * Spatial bootstrapping * Statistical image
	analysis and remote sensing * Computational aspects of model fitting
	* Application of models to disease mapping
	
	
	Including material heretofore unavailable in book form, the book is
	unique in its emphasis on Markov random fields in its presentation
	of models for spatial lattice data. Designed to accommodate the practical
	needs of the professional, it also features the first unified and
	common notation for its subject as well as many detailed examples
	woven into the text, numerous illustrations (including graphs which
	illuminate the theory discussed) and over 1,000 references.
	
	Fully balancing theory with applications, Statistics for Spatial Data
	is an exceptionally clear guide on making optimal use of one of the
	ascendant analytical tools of the decade, one that has begun to capture
	the imagination of professionals in biology, earth science, civil,
	electrical, and agricultural engineering, geography, epidemiology,
	and ecology.},

	Abstract = {This paper deals with the stochastic finite element analysis of nonlinear
	structural dynamic problems, consisting of a linearly elastic square
	plate lying on a nonlinear foundation and loaded with a deterministic
	uniform transverse dynamic load. The plate can be either simply-supported
	or fixed-all-around. The stochasticity of the problem arises from
	the spatial randomness of the elastic modulus of the plate and/or
	from the spatial randomness of a coefficient controlling the degree
	of nonlinearity of the foundation. Monte Carlo simulation techniques
	along with a finite element formulation of the problem are used in
	order to analyze the system. It is concluded that the maximum deflection
	at the center of the square plate fits to the lognormal distribution.
	Various conclusions are also drawn on the influence of the stochasticity
	of the elastic modulus and/or the stochasticity of the nonlinear
	foundation and the degree of nonlinearity of the foundation on the
	value of the coefficient of variation of the maximum deflection at

	Abstract = {In order to perform structural analysis on parallel computers, with
	shared or distributed memory, an iterative approach related to domain
	decomposition methods has been designed. The studied structure is
	described as an assembly defined from two mechanical entities : sub-structures
	and interfaces. The problem is here formulated in the case of linear
	elasticity, for which we are only interested in the final configuration.
	After a description of the principles of this method, a multi-level
	approach is introduced in order to improve performances. Effectively,
	when decomposing into sub-structures, the presence of two scales
	can be noticed (one related to the dimension of the structure, and
	one related to the dimension of the sub-structures). Adding a large
	scale problem on the whole structure allows to quickly broadcast
	information among sub-structures because it takes into account the
	large variation length effects. The goal is to illustrate the feasibility
	and the performances of such an approach, especially for a large
	number of sub-structures. A close attention is devoted to the influence
	of the discretisation choice for the unknowns of the problem, which
	are both displacement and efforts on interfaces.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are stochastic search methods that mimic
	the natural biological evolution and/or the social behavior of species.
	Such algorithms have been developed to arrive at near-optimum solutions
	to large-scale optimization problems, for which traditional mathematical
	techniques may fail. This paper compares the formulation and results
	of five recent evolutionary-based algorithms: genetic algorithms,
	memetic algorithms, particle swarm, ant-colony systems, and shuffled
	frog leaping. A brief description of each algorithm is presented
	along with a pseudocode to facilitate the implementation and use
	of such algorithms by researchers and practitioners. Benchmark comparisons
	among the algorithms are presented for both continuous and discrete
	optimization problems, in terms of processing time, convergence speed,
	and quality of the results. Based on this comparative analysis, the
	performance of \{EAs\} is discussed along with some guidelines for
	determining the best operators for each algorithm. The study presents
	sophisticated ideas in a simplified form that should be beneficial
	to both practitioners and researchers involved in solving optimization
	problems. },

	Abstract = {The response surface methodology (RSM), which typically uses quadratic
	polynomials, is predominantly used for metamodeling in crashworthiness
	optimization because of the high computational cost of vehicle crash
	simulations. Research shows, however, that \{RSM\} may not be suitable
	for modeling highly nonlinear responses that can often be found in
	impact related problems, especially when using limited quantity of
	response samples. The radial basis functions (RBF) have been shown
	to be promising for highly nonlinear problems, but no application
	to crashworthiness problems has been found in the literature. In
	this study, metamodels by \{RSM\} and \{RBF\} are used for multiobjective
	optimization of a vehicle body in frontal collision, with validations
	by finite element simulations using the full-scale vehicle model.
	The results show that \{RSM\} is able to produce good approximation
	models for energy absorption, and the model appropriateness can be
	well predicted by ANOVA. However, in the case of peak acceleration,
	\{RBF\} is found to generate better models than \{RSM\} based on
	the same number of response samples, with the multiquadric function
	identified to be the most stable RBF. Although \{RBF\} models are
	computationally more expensive, the optimization results of \{RBF\}
	models are found to be more accurate. },

	Abstract = {The FETI method and its two-level extension (FETI-2) are two numerically
	scalable domain decomposition methods with Lagrange multipliers for
	the iterative solution of second-order solid mechanics and fourth-order
	beam, plate and shell structural problems, respectively.The FETI-2
	method distinguishes itself from the basic or one-level FETI method
	by a second set of Lagrange multipliers that are introduced at the
	subdomain cross-points to enforce at each iteration the exact continuity
	of a subset of the displacement field at these specific locations.
	In this paper, we present a dual--primal formulation of the FETI-2
	concept that eliminates the need for that second set of Lagrange
	multipliers, and unifies all previously developed one-level and two-level
	FETI algorithms into a single dual--primal FETI-DP method. We show
	that this new FETI-DP method is numerically scalable for both second-order
	and fourth-order problems. We also show that it is more robust and
	more computationally efficient than existing FETI solvers, particularly
	when the number of subdomains and/or processors is very large. Copyright

	Abstract = {A novel domain decomposition approach for the parallel finite element
	solution of equilibrium equations is presented. The spatial domain
	is partitioned into a set of totally disconnected subdomains, each
	assigned to an individual processor. Lagrange multipliers are introduced
	to enforce compatibility at the interface nodes. In the static case,
	each floating subdomain induces a local singularity that is resolved
	in two phases. First, the rigid body modes are eliminated in parallel
	from each local problem and a direct scheme is applied concurrently
	to all subdomains in order to recover each partial local solution.
	Next, the contributions of these modes are related to the Lagrange
	multipliers through an orthogonality condition. A parallel conjugate
	projected gradient algorithm is developed for the solution of the
	coupled system of local rigid modes components and Lagrange multipliers,
	which completes the solution of the problem. When implemented on
	local memory multiprocessors, this proposed method of tearing and
	interconnecting requires less interprocessor communications than
	the classical method of substructuring. It is also suitable for parallel/vector
	computers with shared memory. Moreover, unlike parallel direct solvers,
	it exhibits a degree of parallelism that is not limited by the bandwidth
	of the finite element system of equations.},

	Abstract = {A new method is presented for flexible regression modeling of high
	dimensional data. The model takes the form of an expansion in product
	spline basis functions, where the number of basis functions as well
	as the parameters associated with each one (product degree and knot
	locations) are automatically determined by the data. This procedure
	is motivated by the recursive partitioning approach to regression
	and shares its attractive properties. Unlike recursive partitioning,
	however, this method produces continuous models with continuous derivatives.
	It has more power and flexibility to model relationships that are
	nearly additive or involve interactions in at most a few variables.
	In addition, the model can be represented in a form that separately
	identifies the additive contributions and those associated with the
	different multivariable interactions.},

@article{Heyberger2013,
	Annote = {Abstract This paper deals with the recurring question of the resolution
	of a problem for many different configurations, which can lead to
	highly expensive computations when using a direct treatment. The
	technique which is presented here is based on the use of Proper Generalized
	Decomposition (PGD) in the framework of the LATIN method. In our
	previous works, the feasibility of this model reduction technique
	approach has been demonstrated to compute the solution of a parametrized
	problem for a given space of parameters. For that purpose, a Reduced-Order
	Basis (ROB) was generated, reused and eventually enriched, by treating,
	one-by-one, all the various parameter sets. The novelty of the current
	paper is to develop a strategy, inspired by the Reduced Basis method,
	to explore rationally the space of parameters. The objective is to
	build, with the minimum of resolutions, a ``complete'' ROB that enables
	to solve all the other problems without enriching the basis. We first
	exemplify the existence of a such complete basis by extracting the
	most relevant information from the PGD solutions of the problem for
	all the sets in the space of parameters. Secondly, we propose a rational
	strategy to build this complete basis without preliminary solving
	the problem for all the sets of parameters. Finally, the capabilities
	of the proposed method are illustrated through a variety of examples,
	showing substantial gains when recurrent studies need to be carried
	out.},

@article{Kalagnanam1997,
	Abstract = { The basic setting of this article is that of parameter-design studies
	using data from computer models. A general approach to parameter
	design is introduced by coupling an optimizer directly with the computer
	simulation model using stochastic descriptions of the noise factors.
	The computational burden of these approaches can be extreme, however,
	and depends on the sample size used for characterizing the parametric
	uncertainties. In this article, we present a new sampling technique
	that generates and inverts the Hammersley points (a low-discrepancy
	design for placing n points uniformly in a k-dimensional cube) to
	provide a representative sample for multivariate probability distributions.
	We compare the performance of this to a sample obtained from a Latin
	hypercube design by propagating it through a set of nonlinear functions.
	The number of samples required to converge to the mean and variance
	is used as a measure of performance. The sampling technique based
	on the Hammersley points requires far fewer samples to converge to
	the variance of the derived distributions. An application to off-line
	quality control of a continuous-stirred tank reactor illustrates
	that the Hammersley points require up to 40 times fewer samples to
	converge to the variance of the derived distribution. },

	Abstract = {Over the last fifty years, the ability to carry out analysis as a
	precursor to decision making in engineering design has increased
	dramatically. In particular, the advent of modern computing systems
	and the development of advanced numerical methods have made computational
	modelling a vital tool for producing optimized designs. This text
	explores how computer-aided analysis has revolutionized aerospace
	engineering, providing a comprehensive coverage of the latest technologies
	underpinning advanced computational design. Worked case studies and
	over 500 references to the primary research literature allow the
	reader to gain a full understanding of the technology, giving a valuable
	insight into the world's most complex engineering systems.
	
	Key Features: Includes background information on the history of aerospace
	design and established optimization, geometrical and mathematical
	modelling techniques, setting recent engineering developments in
	a relevant context. Examines the latest methods such as evolutionary
	and response surface based optimization, adjoint and numerically
	differentiated sensitivity codes, uncertainty analysis, and concurrent
	systems integration schemes using grid-based computing. Methods are
	illustrated with real-world applications of structural statics, dynamics
	and fluid mechanics to satellite, aircraft and aero-engine design
	problems. Senior undergraduate and postgraduate engineering students
	taking courses in aerospace, vehicle and engine design will find
	this a valuable resource. It will also be useful for practising engineers
	and researchers working on computational approaches to design.},

	Abstract = {The design of the wings for a transonic civil transport aircraft is
	an extremely complex task. It is normally undertaken over an extended
	time period and at a variety of levels of complexity. Typically,
	simple empirical models are used at the earliest stages of concept
	design, followed by ever more complex methods as the design process
	proceeds towards the final detailed stages. Moreover, this process
	is increasingly dominated by computational methods for both analysis
	(such as CFD) and synthesis (such as optimization). In this paper
	the further development of the Southampton Wing Design Environment
	is described. This Problem Solving Environment (PSE) combines multiple
	analysis methods of differing levels of comlexity with powerful search
	and optimization techniques. A particular focus of the research is
	the use of evolutionary search strategies, such as genetic algorithms,
	and of data fusion between the results of various analysis codes
	when applied to concept design problems.},

	Abstract = {The paper describes the simultaneous topology, material, standard
	and rounded dimension optimization of mechanical structures, performed
	by the Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) approach. Beside
	the generation of an \{MINLP\} mechanical superstructure, the development
	of a general multilevel \{MINLP\} formulation for a mechanical superstructure
	is presented. The consideration of the discrete materials as well
	as standard and particularly rounded dimensions in structural synthesis
	significantly increases the combinatorics of the discrete optimization,
	which as a result may become too difficult to solve. A Linked Multilevel
	Hierarchical Strategy (LMHS) has been introduced for the solving
	of such large combinatorial problems. In order to decrease the effect
	of non-convexities, the Modified Outer-Approximation/Equality-Relaxation
	(OA/ER) algorithm has been applied. Four numerical examples of different
	complexities are presented to illustrate the proposed multilevel
	\{MINLP\} optimization approach: the optimization of two steel trusses,
	a composite I beam and a hydraulic steel roller gate Intake gate,
	erected in Aswan II, Egypt. },

	numerically the behavior of a structure under various imposed excitations,
	forces, and displacements, and then to determine the resulting damage
	to the structure, and ultimately to optimize it so as to minimize
	the damage, subject to various constraints. The method used is iterative:
	at each stage an approximation to the displacements, strains, and
	stresses throughout the structure is computated and over all times
	in the interval of interest. This method leads to a general approach
	for understanding structural models and the necessary approximations.},

	This paper lays the foundations of this strategy by presenting a
	method for constructing an approximation of an objective function.
	This approach consists in coupling a multiparametric mechanical strategy
	based on the LATIN method with a gradient-based metamodel called
	a cokriging metamodel. The main difficulty is to build an accurate
	approximation while keeping the computation cost low. Following an
	introduction to multiparametric and cokriging strategies, the performance
	of kriging and cokriging models is studied using one- and two-dimensional
	analytical functions; then, the performance of metamodels built from
	mechanical responses provided by the multiparametric strategy is

	Abstract = { This paper deals with the building of a gradient-based metamodel
	using a dedicated strategy for solving structural assemblies problems.
	This work is the first part of a two-levels global optimization strategy.
	The general objective is to reduce computation costs; here, we focus
	on the costs which are associated with the generation of the metamodel.
	Our goal is achieved through the introduction of two main elements:
	what we call a ``multiparametric strategy'' based on the \{LATIN\}
	method, which reduces the computation costs when the parameters vary,
	and the use of a cokriging metamodel taking gradients into account.
	Several examples illustrate the efficiency of these two elements.},

	Abstract = {Optimization processes on assembly design are often relatively time
	consuming. This kind of strategy requires a large number of calculations
	to localize the optimum of an objective function. Moreover, these
	calculations are often nonlinear as a result of the contact or friction
	problems. In this context our main purpose is therefore to reduce
	computation time. Therefore a multilevel model optimization process
	[1] and a dedicated mechanical solving strategy are used. Our multilevel
	model optimization uses two levels: the first is composed of a kriging-based
	metamodel and the second one of the full mechanical model. In the
	paper, the proposed study focused on the computation cost to build
	a metamodel using data obtained using the full mechanical model.
	
	Firstly, a specific multiparametric strategy [2] is presented. It
	relies on the LaTIn method developed by Ladev{\`e}ze [3] and using
	a reinitialization process, it allows the computation time to be
	significantly reduced. This strategy was applied on one two-variable
	example to illustrate the method. It appears that the multiparametric
	strategy is very efficient for the calculation of solutions on very
	close sample points.
	
	This property is adapted to coupling the multiparametric strategy
	with a gradient-based metamodel in which the gradients are obtained
	with a finite difference method. Thus a cokriging metamodel [4] is
	presented and compared with a classical kriging metamodel [5]. The
	two kinds of metamodels were applied to one- and two-dimensional
	analytic functions. The main conclusions are that for a same number
	of sample points cokriging provides a better approximation than kriging
	and for a same number of evaluations both metamodels can provide
	a similar approximation.
	
	Finally this specific feature was used on a real mechanical problem.
	Thus the coupling between the metamodel and the multiparametric strategy
	allows us to obtain a good quality of the approximation of the quantity
	of interest with an important gain in terms of computation cost.
	
	These results are not only significant for the building of metamodels
	but also to decrease computation time in gradient-based optimization
	algorithm. This aspect will be crucial in the development of the
	direct optimization on the second level of our multilevel model optimization.

	Abstract = {The problem of designing stable composite plates is considered. In
	a first step, in-plane design of composite plates for high stiffness,
	low thermal and moisture expansion is performed. It is shown that
	([$\pm$ θ1)p($\pm$ 2)q]s stacking sequences are sufficient for in-plane
	design. An expert enumerative algorithm is coupled with an evolutionary
	search to obtain optimal plates for the in-plane problem. In a second
	step, a Monte Carlo laminate analysis is introduced i.e. material
	and geometrical properties are distributed around their nominal value.
	Implications of property distributions on the optimal design are
	discussed. Under the effect of property variations, the coefficients
	of thermal and hygral bending of optimal in-plane designs can take
	on substantial values. Variations in coefficients of thermal and
	hygral bending are minimized by changing the laminate stacking sequence.
	This paper offers a unified approach to reliably designing stable
	composites. Design applications are given for organic and metal matrix
	composites. },

	any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find
	a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many

	Abstract = {Recent work by Johnson et al. (J. Statist. Plann. Inference 26 (1990)
	131--148) establishes equivalence of the maximin distance design
	criterion and an entropy criterion motivated by function prediction
	in a Bayesian setting. The latter criterion has been used by Currin
	et al. (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 86 (1991) 953--963) to design experiments
	for which the motivating application is approximation of a complex
	deterministic computer model. Because computer experiments often
	have a large number of controlled variables (inputs), maximin designs
	of moderate size are often concentrated in the corners of the cuboidal
	design region, i.e. each input is represented at only two levels.
	Here we will examine some maximin distance designs constructed within
	the class of Latin hypercube arrangements. The goal of this is to
	find designs which offer a compromise between the entropy/maximin
	criterion, and good projective properties in each dimension (as guaranteed
	by Latin hypercubes). A simulated annealing search algorithm is presented
	for constructing these designs, and patterns apparent in the optimal
	designs are discussed. },

	Abstract = {Monte Carlo integration is competitive for high-dimensional integrands.
	Latin hypercube sampling is a stratification technique that reduces
	the variance of the integral. Previous work has shown that the additive
	part of the integrand is integrated with error O_p(n^-1/2) under
	Latin hypercube sampling with n integrand evaluations. A bilinear
	part of the integrand is more accurately estimated if the sample
	correlations among input variables are negligible. Other authors
	have proposed an algorithm for controlling these correlations. We
	show that their method reduces the correlations by roughly a factor
	of 3 for 10 ≤ n ≤ 500. We propose a method that, based on simulations,
	appears to produce correlations of order O_p(n^-3/2). An analysis
	of the algorithm indicates that it cannot be expected to do better
	than n^-3/2.},

	la somme, pond{\'e}r{\'e}e ou non, de plusieurs r{\'e}ponses. Ce
	sera le r{\'e}sultat observ{\'e}, ou mesur{\'e}, de l'op{\'e}ration
	effectu{\'e}e, que ce soit une analyse, une synth{\'e}se chimique,
	une extraction, une formulation, etc.Dans tous les cas, la valeur
	de la r{\'e}ponse est subie par l'exp{\'e}rimentateur.La fonction
	objectif d{\'e}pend d'un certain nombre de facteurs. On peut d{\'e}finir
	trois types de facteurs :les facteurs al{\'e}atoires ;les facteurs
	qui seront maintenus {\`a} un niveau donn{\'e} tout au long des exp{\'e}rimentations
	;les facteurs dont on d{\'e}sire faire varier la valeur au cours
	des diff{\'e}rentes exp{\'e}rimentations ; elles seront nomm{\'e}es
	variables.Les variables peuvent {\^e}tre par exemple :le pH ou la
	temp{\'e}rature du milieu r{\'e}actionnel ;la concentration, la masse
	ou le volume de r{\'e}actifs ;le d{\'e}bit d'introduction de solvants,
	etc.Il est {\'e}videmment n{\'e}cessaire que les valeurs des variables
	{\'e}voluent ind{\'e}pendamment les unes des autres.Dans tous les
	cas, la valeur de la variable est impos{\'e}e par l'exp{\'e}rimentateur.Pour
	pouvoir mettre en {\oe}uvre toute technique d'optimisation, il faut
	{\^e}tre capable de maintenir les variables et les facteurs constants
	aux niveaux d{\'e}sir{\'e}s. Il est donc souhaitable que les m{\'e}thodes
	d'optimisation soient mises en {\oe}uvre conjointement avec des techniques
	d'automatisation, de r{\'e}gulation et de contr{\^o}le.Il existe
	de tr{\'e}s nombreuses m{\'e}thodes d'optimisation [1] {\`a} [13].
	La plupart d'entre elles ont {\'e}t{\'e} cr{\'e}{\'e}es pour traiter
	le probl{\'e}me math{\'e}matique consistant {\`a} trouver l'extr{\'e}mum
	de fonctions multivariables, non lin{\'e}aires et soumises, ou non,
	{\`a} des contraintes. Certaines techniques ont {\'e}t{\'e} {\'e}tudi{\'e}es
	dans le but de donner aux exp{\'e}rimentateurs une possibilit{\'e}
	rationnelle de d{\'e}terminer les optimums de fonctionnement de leurs
	syst{\'e}mes physiques.Les m{\'e}thodes d'optimisation peuvent {\^e}tre
	class{\'e}es en fonction du type d'{\'e}tude que l'on souhaite mener.Premier
	cas : le ph{\'e}nom{\'e}ne physique est suffisamment connu pour qu'il
	soit possible de cr{\'e}er un mod{\'e}le repr{\'e}sentatif du ph{\'e}nom{\'e}ne.
	On recherchera alors les extr{\'e}mums de ce mod{\'e}le de connaissance
	par les voies classiques (d{\'e}rivation, m{\'e}thode de Lagrange).Deuxi{\'e}me
	cas : le ph{\'e}nom{\'e}ne {\'e}tudi{\'e} est trop complexe pour
	en d{\'e}terminer un mod{\'e}le physiquement significatif. On d{\'e}sire
	alors seulement obtenir une relation entre les variables et la r{\'e}ponse,
	qui soit repr{\'e}sentative du ph{\'e}nom{\'e}ne {\'e}tudi{\'e}.
	On postulera alors une repr{\'e}sentation math{\'e}matique empirique
	sous forme d'une corr{\'e}lation dont les param{\'e}tres seront ensuite
	d{\'e}termin{\'e}s afin de d{\'e}duire les variables vraiment influentes
	et de calculer a priori les valeurs de la fonction objectif ; on
	utilisera ensuite des m{\'e}thodes d'optimisation pour d{\'e}terminer
	l'optimum de fonctionnement. Dans ce cas, on dit qu'il s'agit d'une
	m{\'e}thode indirecte d'optimisation puisqu'il faut au pr{\'e}alable
	avoir un mod{\'e}le math{\'e}matique.Troisi{\'e}me cas : on d{\'e}sire
	conna{\^\i}tre uniquement les conditions de fonctionnement optimal
	sans rechercher une repr{\'e}sentation math{\'e}matique du ph{\'e}nom{\'e}ne.
	Dans ce cas, il s'agit d'une m{\'e}thode directe d'optimisation puisqu'elle
	ne n{\'e}cessite aucun mod{\'e}le math{\'e}matique.Dans cet article,
	nous d{\'e}crivons uniquement le troisi{\'e}me cas. Le traitement
	du premier cas d{\'e}pend directement du processus {\'e}tudi{\'e}
	et du mod{\'e}le physique correspondant. On rattache {\`a} ce type
	l'optimisation en chromatographie, par les diagrammes {\`a} fen{\^e}tres
	qui impliquent l'utilisation d'une relation lin{\'e}aire connue entre
	la r{\'e}ponse et les variables [14] [15]. Le deuxi{\'e}me cas, quant
	{\`a} lui, a {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}crit dans les Techniques de l'Ing{\'e}nieur
	[16] [17].Nous exposerons d'abord les m{\'e}thodes {\`a} une variable
	et ensuite les m{\'e}thodes {\`a} plusieurs variables.L'article se
	compose de deux parties :la premi{\'e}re, , est consacr{\'e}e aux

	de la m{\'e}thode Simplex.Les r{\'e}f{\'e}rences bibliographiques

@article{Praveen2009,
	Abstract = {Modern optimization methods like Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Particle
	Swarm Optimization (PSO) have been found to be very robust and general
	for solving engineering design problems. They require the use of
	large population size and may suffer from slow convergence. Both
	of these lead to large number of function evaluations which can significantly
	increase the computational cost. This is especially so in view of
	the increasing use of costly high-fidelity analysis tools like Computational
	Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Metamodels also known as surrogate models,
	are a cheaper alternative to costly analysis tools. In this work
	we construct radial basis function approximations and use them in
	conjunction with particle swarm optimization in an inexact pre-evaluation
	procedure for aerodynamic design. We show that the use of mixed evaluations
	by metamodels/CFD can significantly reduce the computational cost
	of PSO while yielding optimal designs as good as those obtained with
	the costly evaluation tool.},

	a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques
	from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector
	machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance
	vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning
	curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation

	Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;The accuracy of many schemes for interpolating
	scattered data with radial basis functions depends on a shape parameter
	c of the radial basis function. In this paper we study the effect
	of c on the quality of fit of the multiquadric, inverse multiquadric
	and Gaussian interpolants. We show, numerically, that the value of
	the optimal c (the value of c that minimizes the interpolation error)
	depends on the number and distribution of data points, on the data
	vector, and on the precision of the computation. We present an algorithm
	for selecting a good value for c that implicitly takes all the above
	considerations into account. The algorithm selects c by minimizing
	a cost function that imitates the error between the radial interpolant
	and the (unknown) function from which the data vector was sampled.
	The cost function is defined by taking some norm of the error vector
	E = (E 1, ... , EN)T where E k = Ek = fk - Sk xk) and S k is the
	interpolant to a reduced data set obtained by removing the point
	x k and the corresponding data value f k from the original data set.
	The cost function can be defined for any radial basis function and
	any dimension. We present the results of many numerical experiments
	involving interpolation of two dimensional data sets by the multiquadric,
	inverse multiquadric and Gaussian interpolants and we show that our
	algorithm consistently produces good values for the parameter},

	The concept of multi-level algorithms is introduced and a case made

	in the development of multi-level algorithms are highlighted. The
	paper goes on to discuss a system developed at Southampton University

	design task. The Southampton University multi-level wing design environment
	integrates drag estimation algorithms ranging from an empirical code
	to an Euler CFD code, covering a 150,000 fold difference in computational

	to continuous domains. We show how ACO, which was initially developed
	to be a metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization, can be adapted
	to continuous optimization without any major conceptual change to
	its structure. We present the general idea, implementation, and results
	obtained. We compare the results with those reported in the literature
	for other continuous optimization methods: other ant-related approaches
	and other metaheuristics initially developed for combinatorial optimization
	and later adapted to handle the continuous case. We discuss how our
	extended \{ACO\} compares to those algorithms, and we present some
	analysis of its efficiency and robustness. },

	solving nonlinear unconstrained optimization problems. Our definition
	unifies an important collection of optimization methods that neither
	compute nor explicitly approximate derivatives. We exploit our characterization
	of pattern search methods to establish a global convergence theory
	that does not enforce a notion of sufficient decrease. Our analysis
	is possible because the iterates of a pattern search method lie on
	a scaled, translated integer lattice. This allows us to relax the
	classical requirements on the acceptance of the step, at the expense

	search algorithm, a direct search method for unconstrained minimization.
	The analysis follows the classic lines of proofs of convergence for
	gradient-related methods. The novelty of the argument lies in the
	fact that explicit calculation of the gradient is unnecessary, although
	it is assumed that the function is continuously differentiable over
	some subset of the domain. The proof can be extended to treat most
	nonsmooth cases of interest; the argument breaks down only at points
	where the derivative exists but is not continuous. Finally, it is
	shown how a general convergence theory can be developed for an entire
	class of direct search methods---which includes such methods as the
	factorial design algorithm and the pattern search algorithm---that
	share a key feature of the multidirectional search algorithm.},

@phdthesis{Torczon1989,
	Abstract = {In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in the development
	of optimization algorithms which exploit the computational power
	of parallel computer architectures. We have developed a new direct
	search algorithm, which we call multidirectional search, that is
	ideally suited for parallel computation. Our algorithm belongs to
	the class of direct search methods, a class of optimization algorithms
	which neither compute nor approximate any derivatives of the objective
	function. Our work, in fact, was inspired by the simplex method of
	Spendley, Hext, and Himsworth, and the simplex method of Nelder and
	Mead. The multi-directional search algorithm is inherently parallel.
	The basic idea of the algorithm is to perform concurrent searches
	in multiple directions. These searches are free of any interdependencies,
	so the information required can be computed in parallel. A central
	result of our work is the convergence analysis for our algorithm.
	By requiring only that the function be continuously differentiable
	over a bounded level set, we can prove that a subsequence of the
	points generated by the multi-directional search algorithm converges
	to a stationary point of the objective function. This is great interest
	since we know of few convergence results for practical direct search
	algorithms. We also present numerical results indicating that the
	multi-directional search algorithm is robust, even in the presence
	of noise. Our results include comparisons with the Nelder-Mead simplex
	algorithm, the method of steepest descent, and a quasi-Newton method.
	One surprising conclusion of our numerical tests is that the Nelder-Mead
	simplex algorithm is not robust. We close with some comments about
	future directions of research.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an empirical study on the efficiency of the simulated
	annealing (SA) algorithm. It considers various parameters such as
	landscape and neighborhood. The need for a better understanding of
	SA, with the additional goal of implementing the algorithm efficiently,
	motivated this study. The method selected to conduct that study was
	to carry out experiments to obtain practical data, which could be
	utilized to carry out a theoretical study simultaneously. Experiments
	on such a stochastic algorithm as \{SA\} were initiated following
	the observation that it is possible to calculate the exact probability
	for \{SA\} to reach any point in the landscape, provided that the
	number of solutions and the number of neighbors per solution are
	small enough. An efficient development of a \{SA\} simulator has
	enabled us to study the influence of the tuning of all the main parameters
	of \{SA\} as well as theoretical concepts such as thermodynamic equilibrium
	and optimal temperature decrement rules. Interesting results have
	been obtained in the field of adaptive cooling schedules that enable
	us to demonstrate that the classical cooling schedules are all equivalent.
	Finally a new schedule has been proposed that exhibits some useful
	properties. The proposed cooling schedule has been successfully implemented
	in the \{SA\} algorithm to solve the well known traveling salesman

	Abstract = {In solving optimization problems for building design and control,
	the cost function is often evaluated using a detailed building simulation
	program. These programs contain code features that cause the cost
	function to be discontinuous. Optimization algorithms that require
	smoothness can fail on such problems. Evaluating the cost function
	is often so time-consuming that stochastic optimization algorithms
	are run using only a few simulations, which decreases the probability
	of getting close to a minimum. To show how applicable direct search,
	stochastic, and gradient-based optimization algorithms are for solving
	such optimization problems, we compare the performance of these algorithms
	in minimizing cost functions with different smoothness. We also explain
	what causes the large discontinuities in the cost functions. },

	Abstract = {The need to optimize a function whose derivatives are unknown or non-existent
	arises in many contexts, particularly in real-world applications.
	Various direct search methods, most notably the Nelder-Mead `simplex'
	method, were proposed in the early 1960s for such problems, and have
	been enormously popular with practitioners ever since. Nonetheless,
	for more than twenty years these methods were typically dismissed
	or ignored in the mainstream optimization literature, primarily because
	of the lack of rigorous convergence results. Since 1989, however,
	direct search methods have been rejuvenated and made respectable.
	This paper summarizes the history of direct search methods, with
	special emphasis on the Nelder-Mead method, and describes recent
	work in this area. This paper is based on a plenary talk given at
	the Biennial Dundee Conference on Numerical Analysis, Dundee, Scotland,
	1995. 1. Introduction Unconstrained optimization---the problem of

	Abstract = {With the aid of the finite element method, the present paper deals
	with the problem of structural response variability resulting from
	the spatial variability of material properties of structures, when
	they are subjected to static loads of a deterministic nature. The
	spatial variabilities are modeled as two‐dimensional stochastic
	fields. The finite element discretization is performed in such a
	way that the size of each element is sufficiently small. Then, the
	present paper takes advantage of the Neumann expansion technique
	in deriving the finite element solution for the response variability
	within the framework of the Monte Carlo method. The Neumann expansion
	technique permits more detailed comparison between the perturbation
	and Monte Carlo solutions for accuracy, convergence, and computational
	efficiency. The result from such a Monte Carlo method is also compared
	with that based on the commonly used perturbation method. The comparison
	shows that the validity of the perturbation method is limited to
	the cases where the material property variation has a relatively
	small coefficient of variation, particularly when Young's modulus
	itself is assumed to form a stochastic field.

	The most important results of this study are: 1. the development
	of a new computational algorithm for the simplex method, which turns
	out to lead to considerably smaller computer terms than any existing
	algorithm; 2. the development of a number of methods for the convex
	programming problems, called methods of feasible directions, which
	use the simplex method as subroutine ; 3. the establishment of an
	equivalence between many existing methods for the linear, quadratic
	or convex programming problem and the methods of feasible directions.
	The author gives a complete survey of the methods in such a way that
	programming for an electronic computer becomes easy. It may safely
	be stated that another important contribution has been made to this
	rapidly growing offshoot of the mathematical sciences.},
